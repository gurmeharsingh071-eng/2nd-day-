I was quite excited to visit Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College for the first time and today was the day I was waiting for. My first day in gndec. So I reached the college at 8.30 sharp. I felt like the whole college welcomed all of us with warmth, love and an inspiration that will remain in all of us forever. 

The day started with a spiritual and peaceful ‘Paath and Kirtan’ at the Gurudwara Sahib of the College giving the best start for the journey of the students coming ahead. 

After this the formal ceremony was held in the auditorium where all the students of branches like Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Electronics, Robotics and AI and Bvoc were introduced to the legacy and great history of this college.

After this the respected principal of our school Dr. Sehajpal Singh told us about the academic excellence of gndec and moreover the achievement of students of gndec while they were persuing their courses.

Then the chief guest of the event S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Ex- Cabinet Minister and the  Trustee of Nankana Sahib Education Trust, motivated the new batch of students with his words on discipline, purpose and the vision of founding of the College.

After the most formal and pleasant welcome all the students headed towards their departments for meeting and exploration of the labs classroom and the facilities of the College. 
It was a day full of inspiration, motivation, tradition and a step towards being a part of this great college.

Day 1 ( 1 August ) Routine of 1 august 
 The day started with a lecture on the topic 'Universal Human Values' by Priya Darshni mam at 9:00 in the morning. As always, mam was gentle and humble in her tone. Then she started the lecture on the topic UHV. Mam asked us what is the difference between happiness and excitement. Like. Whatever we do in hope to get happiness is giving us only excitement not happiness in real meanings. Mam told us a simple thing that there is nothing like getting stressed or depressed due to overthinking. The thing is that we are thinking too much but the thoughts are not matching our actions and that's why we are getting stressed. Mam explained it with such a great example that the main motive of the clothes is to cover  and protect our body from heat and cold. The average human doesn't need too much or fancy clothes for himself to protect his body but under the influence of the world man is consuming too much from nature just to look fashionable so that he gets compliments which only gives man excitement not happiness in real matters. Her words made a great impact on our minds that we  only say that we want to save the environment but when it comes to taking actions we do the totally opposite. After that it was the time for an introduction with Dr. Arvind Dhingra sir. Sir came to the stage and he was full of energy and humour. He talked to some students who had some questions to ask and it was a great time talking to him. After that it was time for a break. After the break it was the English proficiency test. The test was easy and it contained some topics of grammar. After that it was time for the maths proficiency test. It was a bit difficult but I finally made the ends meet. After the maths test the day at the college was over and it was time to go back home.

 Day2 ( 4 August) The day started with a session by the Causmic club in the auditorium at 8.30 sharp in the morning. Our senior Taran came to the stage and introduced herself. She told us about the Causmic club and the Causmic word for the name of the Causmic club came from the word 'Cause' meaning that the club works for a cause to develop the students skills like  speaking in front of others and personality development. Most of the programs and events held in the college were mostly organised and managed by the members of Causmic club and the induction program was also maintained by the members of the Causmic club. After that it was the time for a lecture on the topic of 'Universal Human Values' by Priya Darshni man. Like the last time mam was humble and soothing in her tone. Then she started the lecture. This time she talked to the students about the past lecture and asked some questions to the students and some students gave quite interesting answers to her questions. In this lecture she made us questions ourselves about the existence of ourselves.After this lecture it was time for a break. After having fun with friends during the break it was time for a P2P lecture. Two seniors came and taught us the basics of P2P. As always P2P was the most difficult lecture of the day. After the lecture It was time for a physics lecture but due to some timing problems our teacher couldn't come to attend us. So we were free and we went back home. 

 Day 3 ( 5 August) 

The college started in the afternoon at 1.30 in the auditorium by the lecture on the topic of "Motor sports "by Mr Gautam Murria. Sir came to the stage and wished all of us a very good afternoon and then started talking about motorsports. First of all he wanted to know how many of the students previously knew about motorsports racing and other activities like this. After that he displayed a picture of the blueprint of a formula 1 sports car on the screen and told us that there are more than 20000 parts in this car which are meant to be in the proper condition and fitted properly to perform well. Then he gave us a question about how we can increase the stability of a race car without exceeding some rules. Some students tried to guess but couldn't make it. Then sir revealed the answer. By adding two wheels to the front of a motorsports car its stability is increased. Then sir moved on to the topic of importance of 3M in motorsports racing. Those 3m were Mind, Milliseconds and Machine. Then we were shown a picture on the screen in which we could see two racecars crossing the finish line just by the difference of 2 milliseconds and the other car behind them by 1 millisecond. After that Sir told us that if any of the students are interested in joining the workshop of a motorsports car then they must join the club.Then it was the time for a lecture on Digital marketing by Dr. Amit Kamra. Sir was left with a little time because most of the time was consumed by the motorsports lecture. So sir started his lecture on digital marketing and told us the basics and some advanced rules of digital marketing and some students asked very interesting questions. The lecture was over in a little time and after that it was the lecture on the 'Millets Super Food' topic by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar mam. She came to the stage and started talking about millets. Firstly no one knew what millets basically are and for what are millets used. Later he showed us some pics of millets that we used in our daily life like pearl millet, barnyard millet, kodo millet, foxtail millet and jawar. We didn't know that those things which are available in our homes for so long are called millets. Then, mam told us the benefits of consuming millets. Millets can cure diabetes and cancer and help women in the middle age who have body pain due to the health problems caused by improper nutrition.She told us to add these Millers to our diet in case of weight loss or weight gain. She told us to add these millets to our diet and have a healthy body. Then it was time to go back home .![1000011001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b57ecee1-637d-4a18-b3f1-c35499bf0d91)

Day 4(6 August) 
The day in the college started at 9.30 sharp in the auditorium when all the students gathered together there. Firstly all the students covered their heads and Harpreet mam chose a student to recite the mool mantra for others while the other students heard it and meditated their own energy in themselves. After that Dr Parminder Singh (Dean of  the Student Welfare Club) held the stage and started his lecture. His tone of talking was gentle and soothing. His words were very inspiring and had great motivation in them. After that Mr Manpreet Singh came forward to deliver a lecture on the topic "Fitness for Engineers". He was looking very fit and it can be seen through his personality and his way of standing. Then he started talking about fitness and students took keen interest in his lecture by asking him questions in return. Later sir wanted some volunteers on stage to help him and I was quite excited so I raised my hand and sir called me on stage as a volunteer to show the right way to do push ups and I got on the stage and while I was doing push ups sir said that my posture was good but still it could be done better and after that he called more volunteers on the stage and we all performed push ups on the stage and it was a very different experience for me because it was my first-time doing somethin like this in front of so many people. After that Sir continued his topic and started talking about steroids as one student raised his query about that. His lecture was very inspirational and motivational and last he told all the students present in the auditorium to make a promise that all of us will stay fit and inspire others to be fit. Sir is literally a role model for many people. After that we went to our class to attend the physics lecture by Amarjot mam. It was our first lecture by Amarjot mam. First of all we all gave our introduction and after that mam started talking about the syllabus and the exams procedure and the other important things that we should know. After that she told us about the chapters that we will study later and gave us some topics to research like optical fibre and lasers. After that lecture the college was over and it was a great day in college

Day 5 ( 8 August) 
So today the first lecture was scheduled at 11 in the morning. So it was not a big deal to reach on time. So the lecture was in the seminar hall near the workshop. It was a lecture by Puneet mam.He was very friendly in nature and was very talkative. He told us everything he knew about the exam procedure and the tricks to gain numbers in the exams and he answered all of the students questions very politely. After the lecture it was the time for break and after having too much fun in the break it was the time for a maths lecture in the same previous venue for the maths lecture by Sukhminder sir. Sir was very polite and humble in his tone. He was talking in such a manner that students were very interested in his lecture. Later he introduced us to some applications on the mobile which are proven very useful for us in the fields of mathematics. Apps like  'Desmos' and 'Geogebra' were something we never heard before and that's why we regret it. Those apps are very helpful in making graphs or solving graphical problems and understanding three dimensional objects and their dimensions and designs. After teaching us the right way to use those apps sir casually started a topic about the influence of social media on our daily life and the craze in students to share their every moment detail on social media apps. After this lecture it was time to go back home.

Day6 (11 August) 
So the day started with a lecture about Economics at 8.30 sharp by Jasmine mam. It was our first lecture on Economics. Jasmine mam was looking very pretty and gentle. Then she started the lecture with our introduction and then she asked all of us a question: how do we all explain the word 'economics'. After listening to some answers from the students she started her lecture. First of all she started from some basics like the origin of the word Economics and some important definitions. It was getting interesting but suddenly it was time for another lecture at the workshop. All the students headed towards the workshop and from there all the students were separated and sent to different workshops. I was sent to the Foundry workshop. At first I didn't know a single thing foundry. As soon as we settled down in the workshop sir came into the class. Then sir told us about the importance of workshops in our daily life and the role of workshops in enhancing our marks. After that Sir told us the pattern of the mid semester exams and the discipline which we should adopt while being in the workshop. Later he showed us a gear and asked us if we knew its formation. After a long silence sir broke the silence by giving the answer that whatever thing made out of metal which is hard to manufacture is made easily by foundry. Sir showed us some more things made out of steel in the foundry workshop. Then sir showed us how to prepare a mould to create a gear or any type of shape or thing we wanted to make. After this great session in the workshop it was the time to attend the drawing class by Jagdeep sir. Sir came into the class and started a casual talk about drawing and what we knew about drawing. Then he introduced us to the engineering drawing and some equipment used in the engineering which we have never heard of before. As it was our first day nobody had the equipment so sir told us to bring the equipment as soon as possible so he could teach us. After this lecture it was the time to leave the college for today and go back home.

Day 7 ( 12 august) 
The day started with the maths lecture but due to some circumstances our teacher couldn't reach the class. So two seniors came and attended the class.They told us about the clubs going in the college and some other stuff. After that they gave us some problems of differential equations to solve. After that it was the time for a physics lecture by Amarjot mam. Firstly she took the attendance of all students and then continued the topic from the last lecture of lasers.After attending the physics lecture we all headed to the computational lab for the next lecture where we operated computers. After spending an hour in the computational lab some of the Students went to seminar hall to attend the program arranged for the students to guide them for applying scholarships. Later it was the time for going to the physics lab. Visiting the physics lab for the first time was very interesting. Sir told all the students to make a group of three to study a project and then all of us were given a manual from which we could know about the procedure and apparatus of the project. After that I and two more boys from my section were made into a group to perform an experiment in which we have to find the value of plank's constant. It was very interesting to work in the physics lab and it was something new to learn. And like this it was time to say goodbye to college for the day.![1000010998](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2089d66f-8dae-4f0e-91ce-dcf0f1bfd767) 

Day 8 (13 August) 
The day started with a lecture of the subject Engineering drawing and computer graphics by Sir Harpuneet Singh at 8.30 sharp in the morning.Firstly sir told us about the dimensions of writing the alphabets and the proper way of writing them. Then sir told us to note it down and after that we all started drawing it on the graph paper. At first it was getting very difficult but with the help of sir we did it . After that it was the time of lowercase letters of alphabets. After spending some time on the lowercase letters it was the time for numerical values. After this lecture it was the time of a physics lecture by Amarjot mam. First she  took attendance of all students then she continued the topic which she left in half yesterday. Then she completed the theorem and all the students wrote it down. After the lecture it was a break and after getting fresh enough to attend the lectures it was the time of an economics lecture by Sanjam mam. Mam started the lecture with some basic definitions of economics and introduction to some great people in economics. After a great lecture it was the time of the maths lecture by Rajbir mam. Mam gave us some partial differential equations to solve and after solving the equations mam told us to help the students which are facing a problem to solve the equations. After solving the problems the day was over at the college and it was time to go Back home.

Day9 (14 August) The day started with an interesting lecture of maths by Mam Rajbir kaur. She was very familiar in her tone. She taught us partial differential and some fundamentals of integration and differentiation. Then she gave some examples to the students to solve and after it she solved some examples on the blackboard which were getting a little difficult to solve. After the maths lecture it was the time for a physics lab. Physics lab was interesting as always. Due to the  change in section I had to take up a new project. Firstly I was given the plank's constant project but this time I was assigned with the ultrasonic wave project. It was the most difficult project I have ever seen. The project was too crucial to handle and it had very little and fine details to measure. After Talking to sir about the project sir taught us how to make measurements and the working of the screw gauge placed on the project. After the physics lab it was time for a  break. After getting fresh in the break I went to class to attend the physics lecture by Amarjot mam . In today's lecture she completed the Einstein's theory of radiations and told us some conceptual questions from the unit and then proceeded forward.Then afterwards we solved some numerical and after being done with all the work mam took our attendance and then after some moments,the lecture was over. After this there were no lectures so it was time to go back home.
